### Prompt

Radio buttons and check boxes are two of many different kinds of components that can be included in a graphical user interface. How are they similar and how are they different? Which kind requires grouping? Give an example of an application where each of these two types of GUI components might be useful.

### Response

Radio buttons and check boxes both present selections to the user so they can select options. Radio buttons must be grouped and only one at a time can be selected. Check boxes are ungrouped and any number can be selected at a time.

To continue with the knitting theme of my examples, I created a GUI for a, hypothetical, stash application. The user would use the application to add either yarn or fibre (for spinning yarn) to their stash. They could then select the fibre contents of the item they are stashing. Yarn and spinning fibre can be composed of multiple types of fibres. My example shows some varieties of wool.

My attached code creates the GUI. I did not create any listeners for this example. My hypothetical application would like present the user with more options then write the info to a csv or database.

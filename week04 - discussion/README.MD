### Prompt

Give an example of a program that creates a GUI with at least one button and several textfields. Some of the textfields should be for input and others for output. Make the output textfields uneditable. When the button is clicked, the input fields should be read, some calculation performed and the result displayed in the output textfield(s).

### Response

I created a "Simple Hat Calculator". It allows a user to enter the desired finished size of a hat and their knitting gauged (the number of stitches they are knitting per inch with the needles and yarn they are using) and will return the number of stitches they should cast on for the desired hat. The finished size and gauge can both be entered with decimals and the calculation will appropriately round to return a whole number of stitches. The calculation will also compute the value based on the hat having 2 inches of negative ease (standard when knitting a hat... you knit it a bit smaller than the head you are knitting for so it can stretch and stay in place). The GUI has two input fields, one output field and a button.
